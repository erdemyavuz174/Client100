This means you can use one version of LRT to gather usage data from different Automation Engine versions (e.g. test/production systems). For more information compatibility of Automic software, see the Automic Compatibility Checker.  - Massive speed improvements: Due to query parallelisation, LRT is up to 400% faster.  - Incremental reports using time ranges: Customers with large Automation Engine databases benefit from incremental reports that only consider the usage data in a specific time range (e.g. last month). This incremental approach can speed up LRT even more than query parallelisation and makes it easy to schedule the report generation in Automation Engine.  - Improved command-line interface: The new command-line API is more intuitive and responsive.
